# Anoamly_detection_with_TP-FDS
This repository contains traffic data with anomalies being labeled by 20 different experts using TP-FDS. 
A Python code is also included that applies Fast-ABOD to traffic data benefiting from the TP-FDS.

The labeled data can be found in the Labeled Data folder. Data collected in Melbourne arterials are the files named with a single number and a letter. 
The name of the sites used from the Seattle loop data are mentioned in the name of the other four csv files. 
More information about the Seattle dataset can be found in: https://github.com/zhiyongc/Seattle-Loop-Data 

A demonstration of the labeling procedure can be found in: https://youtu.be/I7wv8SyDsaQ
A TP-FDS demonstration of the data from 14-E.csv is shown here with colors indicating the anomaly probability.
